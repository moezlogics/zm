--  ON : first view of an order = "Order Placed"
--       any later view         = "Order Canceled — out of stock"
--  OFF: normal behaviour (real order status only)

--  Turn it ON:

--  !!! Turn it OFF as soon as stock returns, otherwise real orders that
--      you CAN fulfil will also be shown to customers as canceled:
--    sudo -u postgres psql -d zmobilepkdb -c "UPDATE site_setting SET value='false' WHERE key='order_out_of_stock_mode';"
